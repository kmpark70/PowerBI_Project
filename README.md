# PowerBI_Project

Create a dashboard that highlights the compliance KPIs for Oak Grove (OG) and Pine Ridge (PR) on a monthly basis with a semi-annual outlook.  Provided are the monthly data for August and September, the processing file, and the compliance status monitoring file.  You should seek to improve the existing processing and design a dashboard that will present up-to-date KPI’s which retrieve the latest data either automatically or with minimal effort.  You will have the opportunity to present your dashboard to the Captis team.

KPI’s
Average semi-annual exceedance %
Average semi-annual omission %
Data context – indicate what the semi-annual window is and how much of the semi-annual window is being reported on in the KPI values
Data context – clearly indicate which site the data corresponds to

Input Data
Consists of locally collected and stored data (Rovisys SCADA system) and cloud data (MyPlant)

Data Processing
Processing is performed monthly in the Compliance Tracker file for each site.  There, the Rovisys and MyPlant data are queried and copied into the spreadsheet.

Semi-Annual Report Preparation
The Exceedance and Omission Counter portion of the monthly Compliance Tracker files is copied and pasted into this file to track the compliance performance on a monthly basis with a semi-annual outlook.
