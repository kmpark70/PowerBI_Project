Create a dashboard that highlights the compliance KPIs for Oak Grove (OG) and Pine Ridge (PR) on a monthly basis with a semi-annual outlook.  Provided are the monthly data for August and September, the processing file, and the compliance status monitoring file.

Processing is performed monthly in the Compliance Tracker file for each site.  There, the Rovisys and MyPlant data are queried and copied into the spreadsheet.

Semi-Annual Report Preparation

The Exceedance and Omission Counter portion of the monthly Compliance Tracker files is copied and pasted into this file to track the compliance performance on a monthly basis with a semi-annual outlook.
